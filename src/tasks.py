"""Background agent tasks (multi-instance mode).

Agent turns run as detached asyncio tasks: the job keeps running no matter
which chat is open in the browser — or whether any browser is connected.
Every SSE frame gets a sequence number and is fanned out to:
  - live subscribers (a private asyncio.Queue per connection — two tabs or
    a reconnect all receive every frame),
  - a bounded in-memory ring buffer (replay for late joiners / reconnects),
  - the DB `events` table for structural events (forensics / future replay).
Thinking bursts are the one exception to "deltas stay in memory": each
burst (a run of consecutive `thinking` frames, closed by any other event)
is persisted as ONE `thinking_burst` row, so a viewer who re-attaches
after the ring buffer evicted the early frames still sees the reasoning.
